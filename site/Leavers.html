<h1>Leavers Process</h1>
<p>Leavers can be submitted through the self-service portal.<br>


<p>Leaver’s requests can be raised through the self-service portal or manually via SCSM as a Service Request.<br>
A leaver request will usually come in through the self-service portal or via email. 
</p>
<h3>How to raise a Leaver Request via Self Service Portal?</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Go to myit.woodgroup.com</li>
<li>Click on new start, transfer or leaver</li>
<li>Click on go to request form</li>
<li>Now continue inputting user details into the form. Don't leave any sections blank.</li></ol>
<h3>Points to consider:</h3>

<h3>Once you have completed all 7 pages of the form you can submit the request. What happens now is:</h3>
<ol>
<li>The ticket will create an automatic MA which will be sent for approval.</li>
<li>The ticket will automatically be assigned to the Service Desk queue<br> where the queue manager will keep the ticket until the approval is received.</li>
<li>Once the approval is received, the ticket will be assigned to the relevant teams to process.</li>
</ol>
<h3>How to manually raise a Leaver Request?</h3>
<p><b>These requests will normally come in via email because it’s too much information to enter into a request over the phone.</b></p>
<p><i>Note – depending on the type of user access they require you will have to log several tickets. <br>For example, a new joiner account who requires an email ID, a phone ID and access to a shared mailbox would require 4 separate tickets.</i></p>

<pre>
To proceed with the request, you need to gather the minimum data. Once you have received a request you need to confirm you have the following information:<br>
	Title
	Office (Where the employee will be reporting to)
	Office phone
	Employee’s manager
	Full company name
	Network access to be removed (e.g. shared drives/server access/mailbox access)
	Did you have a telephone extension which will be deleted? (telephony number for office phone)
	Do you currently have a smart phone?<br>
If you haven’t been provided with the correct information then you can email the requester.
